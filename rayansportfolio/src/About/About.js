       I graduated with a Law (Hons) LLB in 2020 but soon realised that my true passion lay elsewhere. In search of a career that would allow me to be creative, I discovered software development. Over the past few years I have completed multiple bootcamps (SheCodes and Iungoâ€™s Software Development), and I am now committed and eager to the art of building dynamic, responsive and user-friendly websites.

       Outside the bootcamps I am continuously learning and evolving in my development journey by focusing on expanding my skills through ongoing CPD opportunities. My most recent personal project involved building a bubble tea website with React, where I applied my growing skills and learned valuable lessons with each line of code.

       While my previous experience has primarily been in customer service and administration, I am now eager to use my newfound skills in web development to create innovative and creative websites. As for now I am actively seeking a role while pursuing additional developmental courses and opportunities to further enhance my skills, allowing me to  continue to create and contribute effectively in future roles.
